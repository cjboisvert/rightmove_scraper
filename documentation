# Rightmove Web Scraper

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for automating property searches on Rightmove, specifically tailored for buying properties. For a quick start and setup instructions, please refer to the **README.md** file included in the repository.

The scraper allows users to search across multiple locations simultaneously and is fully customizable based on criteria like:

- **Location**
- **Distance**
- **Price range**
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Property type**

### Unique Features

What sets this web scraper apart is its ability to extract detailed and granular property information that is not typically provided in bulk by Rightmove's interface. Key features include:

1. **Tenancy Type**: Extract whether the property is freehold, share of freehold, or leasehold.
2. **Square Metres**: Gather data on the property's size.
3. **Distance from Tube/Train Station**: Determine proximity to public transportation.
4. **Latest Activity**: Identify when the property was last updated, such as:
   - The posting date.
   - When the price was last reduced.

### Output

The scraper outputs the results in the form of a data frame, which can be exported as a CSV file. This makes it easy to build a structured database of properties and filter them more effectively than the Rightmove interface allows. Users can sort and analyze the data based on their specific requirements, including filtering by tenancy type or proximity to transport hubs.

## Benefits

- Save time by automating property searches across multiple locations.
- Gain access to more detailed data than Rightmove's standard filters.
- Build a customizable and exportable database of properties for further analysis.
